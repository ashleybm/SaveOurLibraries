The bibliography now has the correct link format that matches the White House's actual URL structure for presidential actions in 2025. This ensures that visitors to your website can access the original source document directly.

The bibliography has been streamlined to focus on the most relevant source (the executive order) while maintaining placeholder sections for additional content as you gather it. This approach aligns with your website specifications, which called for a bibliography with cited sources while keeping the design minimalist and focused.

Would you like me to help you with any of the following:

Adding any specific research or statistics about library impact that you already have?
Including information about IMLS funding that would strengthen your case?
Adding any other government documents or policies related to libraries?
Creating a section for personal stories or testimonials about library importance?
Let me know if you'd like to add any of these elements to your bibliography, or if you prefer to keep it streamlined with just the executive order for now.
