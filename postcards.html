            <h2>About Our Postcard Program</h2>
            <p>Our postcard program provides beautifully designed, library-themed postcards at cost to support grassroots advocacy efforts. These postcards make it easy to send a powerful message to decision-makers about the importance of libraries in our communities.</p>
            <p>All postcards are provided at the cost of materials onlyâ€”we donate our time and do not make a profit. This is our way of supporting library advocates and making it easier for everyone to take action.</p>

        <section class="postcard-impact">
            <h2>The Impact of Postcards</h2>
            <p>Handwritten postcards are a powerful advocacy tool for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal touch:</strong> Handwritten messages stand out in an age of digital communication</li>
                <li><strong>Physical presence:</strong> Postcards take up space in an office and create a visual impact</li>
                <li><strong>Constituent evidence:</strong> They provide tangible evidence of constituent concerns</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Writing postcards is an advocacy method accessible to people of all ages and abilities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When many people send postcards about the same issue, it demonstrates widespread community concern and can influence decision-making.</p>
