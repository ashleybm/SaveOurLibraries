            <h1>About Save Our Libraries</h1>
        </section>

        <section class="about-mission">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Save Our Libraries is a grassroots initiative created in direct response to the White House executive order "CONTINUING THE REDUCTION OF THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY" (March 14, 2025), which explicitly targets the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) for elimination. Our mission is to protect and preserve public libraries across the country from this immediate threat.</p>
            <p>We aim to mobilize community members and voters to take urgent action in opposition to this executive order, specifically Section 2(a)(iv) which targets IMLS. We believe that libraries are essential community resources that must be defended from political attacks that threaten their existence.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="about-why">
            <h2>The Current Threat</h2>
            <p>On March 14, 2025, the White House issued an executive order that specifically targets the Institute of Museum and Library Services for elimination. The order states that "the non-statutory components and functions of [IMLS] shall be eliminated" and statutory functions reduced "to the minimum presence and function required by law."</p>
            <p>This is not a vague policy changeâ€”it's a direct attack on the primary federal funding source for libraries nationwide. Without IMLS:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rural libraries</strong> will lose critical funding that keeps their doors open</li>
                <li><strong>Technology access</strong> in underserved communities will be severely limited</li>
                <li><strong>Educational programs</strong> for children and adults will be cut</li>
                <li><strong>Job search assistance</strong> and workforce development will be reduced</li>
                <li><strong>Community services</strong> that many vulnerable populations rely on will disappear</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This executive order represents an existential threat to libraries across America, particularly in communities that need them most.</p>

It was "vibe coded" because saving libraries is important, and I'd rather spend my time mailing and making postcards than perfecting code.
